# arXiv Vanity

[arXiv Vanity](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com) renders papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) as responsive web pages so you don't have to squint at a PDF.

It turns this sort of thing:

Into this:

This is the web interface for viewing papers. The actual LaTeX to HTML conversion (the interesting bit) is done by [Engrafo](https://github.com/arxiv-vanity/engrafo).

## Running in development

Install Docker for Mac or Windows.

Do the initial database migration and set up a user:

    $ script/manage migrate
    $ script/manage createsuperuser

Build engrafo-dev docker image (needed for rendering papers):

    $ docker build https://github.com/arxiv-vanity/engrafo.git -t engrafo-dev

Then to run the app:

    $ docker-compose up --build

Your app is now available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The admin interface is at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/).

You can scrape the latest papers from arXiv by running:

    $ script/manage scrape_papers

It'll probably fetch quite a lot, so hit `ctrl-C` when you've got enough.

## Running tests

    $ script/test
