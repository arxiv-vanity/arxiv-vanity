# arXiv Vanity

[arXiv Vanity](https://www.arxiv-vanity.com) renders papers from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org) as responsive web pages so you don't have to squint at a PDF.

It turns this sort of thing:

Into this:

This is the web interface for viewing papers. The actual LaTeX to HTML conversion (the interesting bit) is done by [Engrafo](https://github.com/arxiv-vanity/engrafo).

## Contributing

Anyone can contribute to this project.

### Running in development

Install Docker for Mac or Windows.

Do the initial database migration and set up a user:

    $ script/manage migrate
    $ script/manage createsuperuser

Pull the Engrafo Docker image, which is needed for rendering papers:

    $ docker pull arxivvanity/engrafo

Then to run the app:

    $ docker-compose up --build

Your app is now available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The admin interface is at [http://localhost:8000/admin/](http://localhost:8000/admin/).

You can scrape the latest papers from arXiv by running:

    $ script/manage scrape_papers

It'll probably fetch quite a lot, so hit `ctrl-C` when you've got enough.

### Running tests

    $ script/test

### Using a development version of Engrafo

[Engrafo](https://github.com/arxiv-vanity/engrafo) is the LaTeX to HTML converter. If you are working on Engrafo, you might want to use the version you are working on locally.

To do that, run `script/docker-build` in your local Engrafo directory. This will create an image called `engrafo-dev`.

Then, in the arXiv Vanity directory (the same one this readme is in), create a file called `.env` to tell arXiv Vanity to use that image to render papers:

```
ENGRAFO_IMAGE=engrafo-dev
```

### VS Code development environment

This project is configured with a dev container to get completions, etc inside VS Code. When VS Code opens, click "reopen in container" in the popup and it'll run the development environment inside the same container used by `docker-compose`.
